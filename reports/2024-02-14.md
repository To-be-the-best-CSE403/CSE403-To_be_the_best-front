* Team Report
    * Goals from the previous week
        * For the next week we are looking at completing the major features that were promised for the beta release presentation:
        * The ability to view common movesets for a selected Pokemon and import it into the team builder.
           * This will need the data to be put into the database and also have a query setup that responds to a URL request from the frontend (2 days)
           * UI for this is created and can send and respond to the URL request (3 days)
        * A place to view usage stats as well as other information about a Pokemon for a given tier for the beta release it will be done solely for a single tier: OU (overused)
           * Sub goals for this is pretty much the same as above
        * Creating teams based on a chosen archetype
           * Need to finish up the ability to choose an archetype (works for a single one right now) (3 days)
        * An ability to view which of your moves are super-effective/the most damaging on an opposing Pokemon (3 days)

            * Edit the README.md to meet the beta release assignment requirements (3 hours)
            * Continue filling out the Vercel website (1 day)
            * Continue writing functions needed for the backend (2 days)
              * Return the set of widely used Pokemon for a given format (1 day)
              * Return the moves or teammates used for a Pokemon (1 day)
        * Progress and issues
            * I updated the backend README.md to match the information from the frontend README.md
            * I tried to add a bar chart to a Vercel page about Pokemon usage rates but I kept on running into an import error that I tried to debug. I searched up the error and looked at different pages about the error but I could not resolve the error and Vercel could not deploy the website.
        * Goals for the next week
            * Look over the code in our backend in order to add in-line comments and code/API documentation to the Vercel website (2 day)
            * Use the app to add documentation on current features (1 day)
    * Ian
        * Goals from the previous week
            * For this upcoming week, my main goal is to develop the backend so that the extension can show the user the strongest move to choose on an opposing Pokemon in battle.
               * This process includes writing and adjusting queries that retrieve the appropriate data for a Pokemon's moveset.
               * This also includes working with Daniel and Jason to connect the data to the frontend.

    * Fahad
        * Goals from the previous week
            * Goals for the upcoming week include things that would help us get to our beta release. So since my part of the project is mostly the web scraping/data collection and that is not really needed for the beta release since we can use a small set of sample data, I am going to change focus for the next week. But firstly, I will need to finish up the code for putting in some of the basic information for a single Pokemon into the actual database itself (1 day). Additionally, I will take the time to learn our backend and frontend frameworks and contribute to the implementation of some of the other major features for the beta release like the viewer for looking at information for a single Pokemon.
