* Team Report
    * Goals from the previous week
        * For the next week we are looking at completing the major features that were promised for the beta release presentation:
        * The ability to view common movesets for a selected Pokemon and import it into the team builder.
           * This will need the data to be put into the database and also have a query setup that responds to a URL request from the frontend (2 days)
           * UI for this is created and can send and respond to the URL request (3 days)
        * A place to view usage stats as well as other information about a Pokemon for a given tier for the beta release it will be done solely for a single tier: OU (overused)
           * Sub goals for this is pretty much the same as above
        * Creating teams based on a chosen archetype
           * Need to finish up the ability to choose an archetype (works for a single one right now) (3 days)
        * An ability to view which of your moves are super-effective/the most damaging on an opposing Pokemon (3 days)
    * Progress and issues
        * (Write progress and issues here)
    * Goals for the next week
        * (Write goals for the upcoming week here)

        * Progress and issues
            * Had some issues with the injection, will work to fix for the future weeks
            * Worked with Daniel to finalize the look of the front-end
        * Goals for the next week
            * Finish code injection
            * Begin looking for any other minor additions that we can make to improve the UI/UX
            * Implement feedback from the beta release for the front-end
    * Joselyn
        * Goals from the previous week
            * Edit the README.md to meet the beta release assignment requirements (3 hours)
            * Continue filling out the Vercel website (1 day)
            * Continue writing functions needed for the backend (2 days)
              * Return the set of widely used Pokemon for a given format (1 day)
              * Return the moves or teammates used for a Pokemon (1 day)
        * Progress and issues
            * I updated the backend README.md to match the information from the frontend README.md
            * I tried to add a bar chart to a Vercel page about Pokemon usage rates but I kept on running into an import error that I tried to debug. I searched up the error and looked at different pages about the error but I could not resolve the error and Vercel could not deploy the website.
        * Goals for the next week
            * Look over the code in our backend in order to add in-line comments and code/API documentation to the Vercel website (2 day)
            * Use the app to add documentation on current features (1 day)
    * Ian
        * Goals from the previous week
            * My main goal from the previous week was to develop the backend so that the extension can show the user the strongest move to choose on an opposing Pokemon in battle.
               * This process included writing and adjusting queries that retrieve the appropriate data for a Pokemon's moveset.
               * This also included working with Daniel and Jason to connect the data to the frontend.
        * Progress and issues
            * I have made substantial progress in developing an API for determing the strongest move. Such progress includes implementing an algorithm similar to the one used for team building, as well as hardcoding some data for testing.
            * An issue I came across is that I have been unable to fully implement the API with our extension due to time constraints and debgging difficulties.
        * Goals for the next week
            * The goal for the next week is to finish implementing the previously mentioned API. I am determined to finish this within the next few days.
            * Once that has been completed, I plan to finalize SQL queries based for database extraction and verify that such extraction is successful.
            * I also plan to help Joselyn with API documentation and other backend features.
    * Fahad
        * Goals from the previous week
            * Goals for the upcoming week include things that would help us get to our beta release. So since my part of the project is mostly the web scraping/data collection and that is not really needed for the beta release since we can use a small set of sample data, I am going to change focus for the next week. But firstly, I will need to finish up the code for putting in some of the basic information for a single Pokemon into the actual database itself (1 day). Additionally, I will take the time to learn our backend and frontend frameworks and contribute to the implementation of some of the other major features for the beta release like the viewer for looking at information for a single Pokemon.
        * Progress and issues
            * The web scraping and database creation got completed in the last week. So I also did a lot of stuff for the backend. I created some JSONs containing information for the team archetypes. I also wrote some code for the backend for querying information about speicfic pokemon. I also wrote the backend for in battle move analysis algorithm. Which takes in the user's Pokemon and the opponent's Pokemon as well as the move information to calculate the strongest move to use by using the passed information and querying more information about the passed in Pokemon. A major issue in the past week that was encountered was a limit of computational resources from Vercel which makes it harder to use our MySQL database as that goes over the limit. So we need to figure something out regarding that and either see if we can make it more efficient or switch to a different method like using JSONs and storing them locally.
        * Goals for the next week
            * Fix up the code for the move analysis so that it will work with the Vercel limits (2 days)
            * Work on the backend for the Pokemon info queries (2 days)
    * Yassine
        * Goals from the previous week
            * Finish the setup of the database and fix the problem I currently identified
            * Establish an automation that will refresh regularly the database to always be on point with the current data
        * Progress and issues
            * Finished setting up and populating the database and automatized the webscraping and refreshing part
            * Wrote a code to exploit the database and format the result into exploitable data
            * Started an algorithm to select the best team based on the current trend
            * Issue : due to the computing limit of Vercel most of the work on the database is currently not usable
        * Goals for the next week
            * Find and implement a solution for the Vercel problem
            * Fine tune the team creation algorithm
