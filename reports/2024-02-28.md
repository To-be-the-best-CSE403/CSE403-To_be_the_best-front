    * Joselyn
        * Goals from the previous week
            * Go through the app downloading process and make thorough download instructions on the website and README.md's (1 day)

        * Progress and issues
            * After the Thursday meeting, I focused on looking for information that would help us explain to people who aren't familiar with Pokémon why Pokémon, Pokémon Showdown, and our extension for Pokémon Showdown is important.
              * I found information about the amount of traffic going to Pokémon Showdown to explain and support how our extension would be useful to Pokémon Showdown users
              * I also found information about the Pokémon brand/company itself to show why Pokémon and its media is significant
            * With the information I found, I created three About pages on the ToBeTheBest Vercel website, with each page on our extension, Pokémon Showdown, or Pokémon itself
            * On the About the extension page, I made a small section dedicated to pictures for Pokémon Showdown before and after installing our extension
              * However, I didn't add pictures for after our extension was installed (as well as add documentation for the backend) because the frontend and the backend are changing as the final release gets closer
        * Goals for the next week
            * Finish writing up the About pages and find more statistics and graphs to use (2 days)
            * Check to see if there is feedback from the team project review or bete release (TA or professor) feedback (1 day)
            * Work on implementing feedback or help prepare for the final release (3 days)
    * Ian
        * Goals from the previous week
            * For this upcoming week, I plan to finalize the API further and implement it with the extension.
               * This involves working with other team members to conduct testing and other error handling.
            * I also plan to review feedback from the beta release and use it to alter existing code.
