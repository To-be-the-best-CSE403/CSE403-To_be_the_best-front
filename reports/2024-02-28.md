    * Joselyn
        * Goals from the previous week
            * Go through the app downloading process and make thorough download instructions on the website and README.md's (1 day)
               * Use the app and document its features from a user's point of view (1 day)

            * Look over the code in our backend in order to add in-line comments and code/API documentation to the Vercel website (2 day)
        * Progress and issues
            * After the Thursday meeting, I focused on looking for information that would help us explain to people who aren't familiar with Pokémon why Pokémon, Pokémon Showdown, and our extension for Pokémon Showdown is important.
              * I found information about the amount of traffic going to Pokémon Showdown to explain and support how our extension would be useful to Pokémon Showdown users
              * I also found information about the Pokémon brand/company itself to show why Pokémon and its media is significant
            * With the information I found, I created three About pages on the ToBeTheBest Vercel website, with each page on our extension, Pokémon Showdown, or Pokémon itself
            * On the About the extension page, I made a small section dedicated to pictures for Pokémon Showdown before and after installing our extension
              * However, I didn't add pictures for after our extension was installed (as well as add documentation for the backend) because the frontend and the backend are changing as the final release gets closer
        * Goals for the next week
            * Finish writing up the About pages and find more statistics and graphs to use (2 days)
            * Check to see if there is feedback from the team project review or bete release (TA or professor) feedback (1 day)
            * Work on implementing feedback or help prepare for the final release (3 days)
    * Ian
        * Goals from the previous week
            * For the last week, I planned to finalize the API further and implement it with the extension.
               * This involved working with other team members to conduct testing and other error handling.
            * I also planned to review feedback from the beta release and use it to alter existing code.
        * Progress and issues
            * We were able to finalize previous API and integrate it into the extension.
            * I also began and made great progress on the movesets API for the website.
               * This included hardcoding movesets using data collected from the database.
            * I created and began to work on a template for the final presentation as well.
        * Goals for the next week
            * For the next week, I plan to refine and enhance the movesets API (3 days).
               * This might include adding more movesets or creating an archetype-like page.
            * I also plan to work more on the final presentation and to use existing feedback to make changes to our existing framework (1 week).
            * We have also discussed implementing an additional feature to the extension, in which I will provide support as needed (1 week).
    * Fahad
        * Goals from the previous week
            * Finish adding tests for the move selector backend (1 day)
            * Add more error handling and finalize the backend for the move selector algorithm (1 day)
            * Once move selector is done, finally merge the branch into main (< 1 day)
            * Add tests for the backend teambuilder ( 1 day)
            * Start working on backend for the Pokemon info query (2 days)
        * Progress and issues
            * I was able to complete and merge into main the feature branch for the move selector on the backend side of things. I had also created a test suite for it, which it passes all of the tests for.
            * I also created a new branch for another feature, the pokemon info query/viewer (on the backend side of things). The code for it is mostly done, it just needs argument and error handling as well as a test suite written for it.
        * Goals for the next week
            * Wrap up the backend for the Pokemon info viewer (2 days)
            * Work on the presentation/documentation to make sure it is improved from the feedback from last time.
