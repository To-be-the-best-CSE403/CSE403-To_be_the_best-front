    * Joselyn
        * Goals from the previous week
            * Research backend frameworks and pick the one that we believe will be the most suitable
            * Start learning the chosen backend framework and learn how to connect it to the frontend
            * Setup the test-automation framework infrastructure and CI service and add some initial tests
        * Progress and issues
            * Since last week, I've found some text and video resources on Flask that I have started to look through.
                * A video I watched involved creating a Flask web application from scratch and deploying it online.
                * I've also been looking at the testing framework that Flask recommends and reading its documentation.
                * One conceptual issue that I have is connecting the Flask application to the services that we are using/are planning to use.
            *  I have also been looking through the backend repository and understanding the general purpose of the files in the repo
                * Since I am working on the documentation, which will be put onto our Vercel website, I am looking into HTML and CSS resources to help me edit the website to add and format the documentation. 
            *  I have started planning out backend tests
        * Goals for the next week
            * Look for and look through Flask, HTML, CSS, and Vercel resources
            * After looking at Flask resources, start planning and implementing the backend.

        * Goals from the previous week
            * My specific goal from the previous week was to setup the Github backend repository, as well as research and begin implementing backend resources.
        * Progress and issues
            * Joselyn and I were able to successfully create our Github repository with a basic README.md file and folders.
               * One issue I ran into was figuring out what to include in the README.md file, but after looking at some templates online and from other repositories I was able to overcome this challenge.
            * Nathan and I began researching and experimenting with Node.js, Vercel and Flask.
               * There was a small learning curve in getting started with these technologies, but we were able to successfully figure them out and commit changes to the repository.
        * Goals for the next week
            * My goals for next week include designing a basic testing framework for retrieving data from the database.
               * This includes writing SQL query templates that can be further implemented later.
            * Another goal is to continue researching and implementing backend technologies.
