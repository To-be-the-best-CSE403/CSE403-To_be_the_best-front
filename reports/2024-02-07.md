* Team Report
    * Goals from the previous week
        * Finish setting up the testing infrastructure and CI/CD (2 days; Everyone)
        * Write some initial tests for each portion of the project (1 day; Everyone)
        * Start to write the web scraping code for the databases (3 days; Fahad)
        * Add and test API request for teambuilder (1 day; Daniel)
        * Working teambuilder use case for beta release (3 days; Daniel)
        * Create a prototype of the Chrome extension sidebar UI for beta release (3 days; Jason)
        * Look for and look through Flask, HTML, CSS, and Vercel resources (2 days; Joselyn)
        * After looking at Flask resources, start planning and implementing the backend. (3 days; Joselyn, Ian)
        * Designing a basic testing framework for retrieving data from the database (2 days; Ian)
    * Progress and issues
        * We have setup the basic testing infrastructure as well as the CI/CD and also have wrote some basic tests, with the structure for many of the tests that will be needed to be written. With regards to the webscraping, there has not really been a lot done in that regard besides research on how to actually do it (so the code has not been written yet). We have also have a major feature almost completed in time for the beta release, which is the team generator based on a chosen archetype. Lastly, the backend framework research has been going well.
    * Goals for the next week
        * For the next week we are looking at completing the major features that were promised for the beta release presentation:
        * The ability to view common movesets for a selected Pokemon and import it into the team builder.
           * This will need the data to be put into the database and also have a query setup that responds to a URL request from the frontend (2 days)
           * UI for this is created and can send and respond to the URL request (3 days)
        * A place to view usage stats as well as other information about a Pokemon for a given tier for the beta release it will be done solely for a single tier: OU (overused)
           * Sub goals for this is pretty much the same as above
        * Creating teams based on a chosen archetype
           * Need to finish up the ability to choose an archetype (works for a single one right now) (3 days)
        * An ability to view which of your moves are super-effective/the most damaging on an opposing Pokemon (3 days)
* Individual member contributions

        * Goals from the previous week
            * Add and test API request for teambuilder (1 day)

        * Goals for the next week
            * Improve sidebar UI/UX and determine clear user flow and utility. (1 day)
            * Improve documentation on how to use the API and extension (1 day)
            * Add features wiki and visualization of the data on the website (3 days)
    * Jason
        * Goals from the previous week
            * Create a prototype of the Chrome extension sidebar UI for the beta release
        * Progress and issues
            * Began editing CSS for Chrome extension sidebar UI
            * Changed focus to adding a text description for tiers for users to learn more about their selected tier
        * Goals for the next week
            * Add code to inject text descriptions into the Showdown website
    * Joselyn
        * Goals from the previous week
            * Look for and look through Flask, HTML, CSS, and Vercel resources (2 days)
                * Specifically, go through the GeeksForGeeks Flask, HTML, and CSS resources
            * After looking at Flask resources, start planning and implementing the backend (3 days)
        * Progress and issues
            * I've written some unit tests for functions that will be used in the backend
            * I've also started writing a function that returns the scalar for move effectiveness
            * I've made and started to fill out the web pages on the Vercel website for documentation purposes
        * Goals for the next week
            * Edit the README.md to meet the beta release assignment requirements (3 hours)
            * Continue filling out the Vercel website (1 day)
            * Continue writing functions needed for the backend (2 days)
              * Return the set of widely used Pokemon for a given format (1 day)
              * Return the moves or teammates used for a Pokemon (1 day)
    * Ian
        * Goals from the previous week
            * My goals for next week include designing a basic testing framework for retrieving data from the database.
                * This includes writing SQL query templates that can be further implemented later.
            * Another goal is to continue researching and implementing backend technologies.
        * Progress and issues
            * (Write progress and issues here)
        * Goals for the next week
            * (Write goals for the upcoming week here)
    * Fahad
        * Goals from the previous week
            * Add some basic sample Pokemon information directly into the database (1 day)
            * Setup the tests for the database/webscraping part of the project (2 days)
            * Work on the program for the database that will web scrape the data we want from the website and put it into the database (3 days)
        * Progress and issues
            * I have wrote code for putting in some of the basic information for a single Pokemon into the database. However, the code is not currently compiling so that will need to be looked at a little further. I also wrote up some sample JSONs filled with the data that we need for the beta test in regards to making sample teams based on an archetype (this will need to be gathered in a more sophisticated manner past the beta release). But for the beta release presentation this should suffice. Currently, just due to a busy schedule in the past week I have not done anything regarding the web scraping with respect to actually writing the code. But I have researched on how to actually do so in the first place. I did write some of the basic tests for the querying, I just need to clean it up and move it into a different directory with the rest of the tests.
        * Goals for the next week
            * Goals for the upcoming week include things that would help us get to our beta release. So since my part of the project is mostly the web scraping/data collection and that is not really needed for the beta release since we can use a small set of sample data, I am going to change focus for the next week. But firstly, I will need to finish up the code for putting in some of the basic information for a single Pokemon into the actual database itself (1 day). Additionally, I will take the time to learn our backend and frontend frameworks and contribute to the implementation of some of the other major features for the beta release like the viewer for looking at information for a single Pokemon.

        * Goals from the previous week
            * Design and implement the tables so that they store only pertinent data (2 days)
            * Implement the web scraping script fine tune it to be adapted to the websites we are using
            * Setup tests for the part I implemented
        * Progress and issues
