            * Beyond setting up for WHERE2EAT as well as downloading and trying to build/run WHERE2EAT for the peer project review, I haven't been able to do much else due to another class's paper and outside commitments taking up more time than I had expected
            * After looking at the beta release feedback, I am confused on what exactly our architecture should detail and how we could improve the architecture mentioned in the beta release presentation since I had looked at the architecture and design assignment feedback when writing about the architecture.
