        * Goals from the previous week
            * Look over the code in our backend in order to add in-line comments and code/API documentation to the Vercel website (2 day)
            * Use the app to add documentation on current features (1 day)
        * Progress and issues
            * I haven't looked over the backend code yet but I have looked at the website as well as the beta release assignment feedback
            * Beyond setting up for WHERE2EAT as well as downloading and trying to build/run WHERE2EAT for the peer project review, I haven't been able to do much else due to another class's paper and outside commitments taking up more time than I had expected
            * After looking at the beta release feedback, I am confused on what exactly our architecture should detail and how we could improve the architecture mentioned in the beta release presentation since I had looked at the architecture and design assignment feedback when writing about the architecture.
        * Goals for the next week
            * Go through the app downloading process and make thorough download instructions on the website and README.md's (1 day)
               * Use the app and document its features from a user's point of view (1 day)
            * Add in documentation/images talking about which components are from Pokemon Showdown and which components are from the app (2 days)
            * Look over the code in our backend in order to add in-line comments and code/API documentation to the Vercel website (2 day)

            * Once that has been completed, I plan to finalize SQL queries based for database extraction and verify that such extraction is successful.
            * I also plan to help Joselyn with API documentation and other backend features.
